# HSIheatmap
Generating a heatmap of HengSang Index
Info:
The program downloads historical data for the Hang Seng Index (HSI) from Yahoo Finance, calculates the daily performance as a percentage, and generates a heatmap visualizing the average daily performance per day of the month across all months from January 1990 to December 2024, saving the heatmap as an image file.
